This is a WIP. I'm taking an old Royal Safari typewriter and digitizing it by adding an array of buttons on the underside of the machine. When a key is pressed, it will hit a button that triggers a specific voltage input for an Arduino nano. The letter will appear on an LCD dislay, and it will look like the typerwiter is still "stamping" the display. An interface will be created allowing the user to create files on an SD card and write text, and also pan around within the file.  
An end goal is to convert the entire thing into either a standard USB keyboard or a bluetooth keyboard.
